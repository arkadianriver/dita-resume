# dita-resume

> UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Build separate resumes, each highlighting a different job role.

The provided DITA plugin specializes resume elements from the base topic type
and provides a custom XSL-FO PDF transform.

Each entry under a Company section is assigned one or more job roles.
When you build a resume with the custom `resume` transform type,
provide the job role as a category,
and that category will be listed first under the Skills Summary section
and under each Company section.
